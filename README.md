# Work Day Scheduler
This simple application allows users to plan out their work day according to each hour and keep records of tasks that need to be completed.
## Project Description
This application employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. The HTML document encompasses the work day time blocks ranging from 9AM to 5PM. Each time block sections includes the block time, input area for users to add notes, and a save button to record the user's input content. The time blocks are color-coded with CSS to reveal whether the hour is past, present, or future. JavaScript was able to implement the following functionality:
- Retrieves data from Day.js to present the current day, month, and year at the top.
- Stores local data when user clicks on the save button.
- Fetches the stored data for the time blocks even when page is refreshed.
- Compares the current time with the time blocks to color-code whether the time block is past, present, or future.
